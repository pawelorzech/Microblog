To make things easier, I’m reusing the old list with previous defaults and will let you know if and how they have changed.</p>\n<p>📨 Mail Client: Mail.app on both iOS and macOS; for work, Mimestream (Google accounts only). Because I’ve shifted most of my day-to-day activities to a Windows machine (I managed to get a BEAST with 64GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD for under $1,000), I now handle most of my mail in the browser—Fastmail in Vivaldi (personal) and Gmail in Chrome (work). On any of my devices (I use Android personally now, while my iPhone is mainly for work), I use the Fastmail and Gmail apps.</p>\n<p>📮 Mail Server: Fastmail for personal use and Google for work. No changes here!</p>\n<p>📝 Notes: Obsidian, Tot, and Day One. Day One is still here; I have a streak that’s about 300 days long now. For regular notes, I’ve settled on the free version of Standard Notes. When I moved away from the Apple-only ecosystem, I needed something that worked across all OSes, and Standard Notes does.</p>\n<p>✅ To-Do: Akiflow and Things. Akiflow is still going strong; I even paid for five years of it since I’m not planning on dropping it anytime soon. I use it solely for my work calendar and tasks, and it’s made a huge difference for me. For personal tasks, I use Google Tasks. It just works: I add tasks with dates, and they show up when needed. I no longer need the complexity of something like Omnifocus, and it felt great to let go of that.</p>\n<p>📷 Phone Camera: I previously used the Camera app on iPhone exclusively. Now, I take most of my photos with a Google Pixel 8a. The camera on the 8a is amazing, and I love having that 2x zoom button in the camera app.</p>\n<p>🟦 Photo Management: Lightroom—still going strong! Lightroom is fantastic.</p>\n<p>📆 Calendar: Previously used Calendar on iOS and Akiflow on Mac; now it’s Akiflow on PC and the Fastmail app on Android.</p>\n<p>📁 Cloud File Storage: iCloud + Backblaze B2—still my go-to. I’m not using Google Drive yet, and honestly, I don’t know if I need to archive many actual files. Most of my “files” are Google Docs, Sheets, and photos. I have some archives, but it’s only a few gigs of data. I may copy it to Google Drive for access on my Pixel, but I haven’t really needed it in the past year.</p>\n<p>📖 RSS: FreshRSS with Reeder. Since I moved to Android, I now use Read You with FreshRSS. It works well, and I don’t miss Reeder!</p>\n<p>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: Same as before. I use whatever is default on Android.</p>\n<p>🌐 Browser: Arc Browser on Mac and Arc Search on iOS. Arc has gone downhill in recent months, and their Windows app never took off. I dropped Arc entirely and switched to Vivaldi. It works as well as Chrome without actually being Chrome. I don’t care as much about browsers anymore, so Vivaldi it is.</p>\n<p>💬 Chat: Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp—still the same, though I’d rank them differently now: Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram.</p>\n<p>🔖 Bookmarks: Browser.</p>\n<p>📑 Read It Later: Good Links. I’ve stopped using “read it later” tools. If I need to save something for later, I send it to myself via Signal or email. But honestly, I only did that a few times over the entire year. Another thing I let go of!</p>\n<p>🤖 Mastodon: Previously used Ivory and IceCubes. Now, it’s mostly in the browser, and if I’m on my phone, I use Moshidon.</p>\n<p>📖 Blog: micro.blog and Day One.</p>\n<p>⌨️ Launcher: Raycast. I don’t use macOS that much anymore, but when I’m on my MacBook (like right now), I still use Raycast.</p>\n<p>📜 Word Processing: Obsidian. I can’t even remember what I meant by “Word Processing” originally, but I mostly use Google Docs now.</p>\n<p>📈 Spreadsheets: Google Sheets.</p>\n<p>📊 Presentations: Google Slides.</p>\n<p>🛒 Shopping Lists: Previously used Reminders; now I use Google Tasks.</p>\n<p>💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: YNAB.</p>\n<p>📰 News: RSS.</p>\n<p>🎵 Music: Spotify.</p>\n<p>🎤 Podcasts: Pocket Casts.</p>\n<p>🎮 Gaming: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and Anbernic RG35XX.</p>\n<p>🔐 Password Management: 1Password.</p>\n<p>👨🏻‍💻 Terminal: Previously used WebSSH; now I use whatever Windows provides—usually PowerShell or something similar.</p>\n",

Because I’ve shifted most of my day-to-day activities to a Windows machine (I managed to get a BEAST with 64GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD for under $1,000), I now handle most of my mail in the browser—Fastmail in Vivaldi (personal) and Gmail in Chrome (work). On any of my devices (I use Android personally now, while my iPhone is mainly for work), I use the Fastmail and Gmail apps.\n\n📮 Mail Server: Fastmail for personal use and Google for work. No changes here!\n\n📝 Notes: Obsidian, Tot, and Day One. Day One is still here; I have a streak that’s about 300 days long now. For regular notes, I’ve settled on the free version of Standard Notes. When I moved away from the Apple-only ecosystem, I needed something that worked across all OSes, and Standard Notes does.\n\n✅ To-Do: Akiflow and Things. Akiflow is still going strong; I even paid for five years of it since I’m not planning on dropping it anytime soon. I use it solely for my work calendar and tasks, and it’s made a huge difference for me. For personal tasks, I use Google Tasks. It just works: I add tasks with dates, and they show up when needed. I no longer need the complexity of something like Omnifocus, and it felt great to let go of that.\n\n📷 Phone Camera: I previously used the Camera app on iPhone exclusively. Now, I take most of my photos with a Google Pixel 8a. The camera on the 8a is amazing, and I love having that 2x zoom button in the camera app.\n\n🟦 Photo Management: Lightroom—still going strong! Lightroom is fantastic.\n\n📆 Calendar: Previously used Calendar on iOS and Akiflow on Mac; now it’s Akiflow on PC and the Fastmail app on Android.\n\n📁 Cloud File Storage: iCloud + Backblaze B2—still my go-to. I’m not using Google Drive yet, and honestly, I don’t know if I need to archive many actual files. Most of my “files” are Google Docs, Sheets, and photos. I have some archives, but it’s only a few gigs of data. I may copy it to Google Drive for access on my Pixel, but I haven’t really needed it in the past year.\n\n📖 RSS: FreshRSS with Reeder. Since I moved to Android, I now use Read You with FreshRSS. It works well, and I don’t miss Reeder!\n\n🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: Same as before. I use whatever is default on Android.\n\n🌐 Browser: Arc Browser on Mac and Arc Search on iOS. Arc has gone downhill in recent months, and their Windows app never took off. I dropped Arc entirely and switched to Vivaldi. It works as well as Chrome without actually being Chrome. I don’t care as much about browsers anymore, so Vivaldi it is.\n\n💬 Chat: Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp—still the same, though I’d rank them differently now: Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram.\n\n🔖 Bookmarks: Browser.\n\n📑 Read It Later: Good Links. I’ve stopped using “read it later” tools. If I need to save something for later, I send it to myself via Signal or email. But honestly, I only did that a few times over the entire year. Another thing I let go of!\n\n🤖 Mastodon: Previously used Ivory and IceCubes. Now, it’s mostly in the browser, and if I’m on my phone, I use Moshidon.\n\n📖 Blog: micro.blog and Day One.\n\n⌨️ Launcher: Raycast. I don’t use macOS that much anymore, but when I’m on my MacBook (like right now), I still use Raycast.\n\n📜 Word Processing: Obsidian. I can’t even remember what I meant by “Word Processing” originally, but I mostly use Google Docs now.\n\n📈 Spreadsheets: Google Sheets.\n\n📊 Presentations: Google Slides.\n\n🛒 Shopping Lists: Previously used Reminders; now I use Google Tasks.\n\n💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: YNAB.\n\n📰 News: RSS.\n\n🎵 Music: Spotify.\n\n🎤 Podcasts: Pocket Casts.\n\n🎮 Gaming: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and Anbernic RG35XX.\n\n🔐 Password Management: 1Password.\n\n👨🏻‍💻 Terminal: Previously used WebSSH; now I use whatever Windows provides—usually PowerShell or something similar.\n",

Honestly, it&rsquo;s always on point and the suggestions are always wild (but good wild). But in terms of being understood by a piece software, recently I&rsquo;ve made multiple changes to automations working in our home due to finally having time to sit down and take a peak into what Home Assistant allows. And since then I had thoughts like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting too hot&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting too dark&rdquo; and at - literally at this second, HA turned on a thing because it became exactly too hot or too dark.</p>\n<p>Doing buttons, clicking them to do a thing is obviouisly an upgrade from manually doing things, but I think I finally understood what does it mean to have &ldquo;the smart home&rdquo;. My current approach is that whenever something happens or just annoys me (or the wifey) - I try to either make automation at this moment or I write down what happened and what could happen.

				"content_text": "Spotify's daylist is something different. I haven't been that understood by a piece of music-related software. Honestly, it's always on point and the suggestions are always wild (but good wild). But in terms of being understood by a piece software, recently I've made multiple changes to automations working in our home due to finally having time to sit down and take a peak into what Home Assistant allows. And since then I had thoughts like \"it's getting too hot\" or \"it's getting too dark\" and at - literally at this second, HA turned on a thing because it became exactly too hot or too dark. \n\nDoing buttons, clicking them to do a thing is obviouisly an upgrade from manually doing things, but I think I finally understood what does it mean to have \"the smart home\". My current approach is that whenever something happens or just annoys me (or the wifey) - I try to either make automation at this moment or I write down what happened and what could happen. Also now I get why would I buy light sensors, air quality sensors and - most importantly - occupancy sensors. Having that additional information about room being occupied is great.

Interesting observation. Today it is in a case, but on the weekend it’s going to be a case off situation. This was a post about me using a case sometimes. I do think about such things too much. \n",

Since then, I've bought my first PC in 15 years that I love and adore and use every day. There's no way I'm going to ditch my MacBook Air for something that has Windows on it (Apple machines are of better quality and I love macOS on laptops), but I think on desktop, Windows is working actually really, really well.\n\nLet's start with the defaults first, and then I'm going to provide you with some more content regarding my software EDC because that has to change a lot since I'm on Windows more than I'm on macOS.\n\n📨 Mail Client: I use [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u26294944) for personal use and Gmail for work. Therefore, on iOS, I use mail.app + Gmail, on macOS I use browsers only, and on Windows, I use a browser only too.\n\n📮 Mail Server: [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u26294944) for personal use, Google for Work.\n\n📝 Notes: Obsidian and Tot for quick notes, but I'm moving my quick notes more and more to...\n\n✅ To-Do: Microsoft To Do!

It is time to share my photos from my last holiday. In January, I visited the (not so close) island of Tenerife and stayed there for a while.

We did enjoy a bit of pool time. It was a great time to just sit down, put on some music and relax. But then, second week comes and we find ourselves driving car more and more, so we had a chance to take a look around the island.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ce22ca5713.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1119.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1512\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/d42782f158.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1983.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/22b3469beb.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1745.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/5d6362e0f1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1825.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/5f176a695e.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1920.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ba5393accb.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1939.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/f104d8a535.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1953.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/94be35fc46.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1952.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\nOf course we had to snag some sweet pics of sunset but I just couldn't resist doing it.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/2e0559bc15.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1994.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2735\" height=\"1217\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ed42134f7c.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2020.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/a0d2094e4d.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2040.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/c2e2239553.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2048.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1310\" height=\"1965\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/a5cbeec23f.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2057.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/625d1b8a07.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2051.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ec76397f38.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2045.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\nThen, for a brief moment - sky turned pink.

We went to see the nearby mountain (that's actually a volcano) - El Teide.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/bf551c5604.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2095.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/b6023cfd29.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2097.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/e3308e73f5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2103.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/98bbee0683.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2104.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\nTo change a scenery a bit we moved down, to the top-right area of a map. I'm pretty good with geography as you can see. Top right, Tenerife, top right area on the map.

That unfortunately made our life a little bit worse for a moment. There was no more pretty sunsets and everything turned a bit orange. So we got not-the-best goodbye from Tenerife but that's fine.
