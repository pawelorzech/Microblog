Whenever I think about the iPhone, I remind myself that this tool has better assistant, better screen, does the same job and have OUT OF THIS WORLD notification system. And - that was new to me, seriously - these are to me worth more than iOS ecosystem? And the funny part of that is because I've moved from Apple to more open Google (evil, but a bit more open) - I can still access my photos and messages on my Mac. Because they are available in the web.\n\nCrazy experience. I know we said these things about Apple, but they just figured some nice things out. You're getting to bed and plugging up your phone? It's getting darker and black & white, so you go to sleep instead of scrolling. Someone's calling you and you can't answer now? Flip your phone screen down and it will be silenced because obviously. \n\nSo, if anyone asks - I do like Pixel 8a.\n",

When it’s in the case it feels more like a tool, but when I take it out of the case it’s just a nicely designed object. I fidget with naked phone much more than I do with a grippy case. Interesting observation. Today it is in a case, but on the weekend it’s going to be a case off situation. This was a post about me using a case sometimes. I do think about such things too much. \n",

Since then, I've bought my first PC in 15 years that I love and adore and use every day. There's no way I'm going to ditch my MacBook Air for something that has Windows on it (Apple machines are of better quality and I love macOS on laptops), but I think on desktop, Windows is working actually really, really well.\n\nLet's start with the defaults first, and then I'm going to provide you with some more content regarding my software EDC because that has to change a lot since I'm on Windows more than I'm on macOS.\n\n📨 Mail Client: I use [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u26294944) for personal use and Gmail for work. Therefore, on iOS, I use mail.app + Gmail, on macOS I use browsers only, and on Windows, I use a browser only too.\n\n📮 Mail Server: [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u26294944) for personal use, Google for Work.\n\n📝 Notes: Obsidian and Tot for quick notes, but I'm moving my quick notes more and more to...\n\n✅ To-Do: Microsoft To Do!

It is time to share my photos from my last holiday. In January, I visited the (not so close) island of Tenerife and stayed there for a while.

We did enjoy a bit of pool time. It was a great time to just sit down, put on some music and relax. But then, second week comes and we find ourselves driving car more and more, so we had a chance to take a look around the island.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ce22ca5713.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1119.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1512\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/d42782f158.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1983.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/22b3469beb.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1745.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/5d6362e0f1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1825.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/5f176a695e.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1920.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ba5393accb.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1939.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/f104d8a535.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1953.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/94be35fc46.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1952.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\nOf course we had to snag some sweet pics of sunset but I just couldn't resist doing it.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/2e0559bc15.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_1994.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2735\" height=\"1217\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ed42134f7c.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2020.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/a0d2094e4d.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2040.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/c2e2239553.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2048.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1310\" height=\"1965\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/a5cbeec23f.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2057.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/625d1b8a07.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2051.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/ec76397f38.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2045.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\nThen, for a brief moment - sky turned pink.

We went to see the nearby mountain (that's actually a volcano) - El Teide.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/bf551c5604.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2095.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/b6023cfd29.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2097.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/e3308e73f5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2103.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"2736\" height=\"1824\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96132/2024/98bbee0683.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_2104.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" />\n\n\nTo change a scenery a bit we moved down, to the top-right area of a map. I'm pretty good with geography as you can see. Top right, Tenerife, top right area on the map.

That unfortunately made our life a little bit worse for a moment. There was no more pretty sunsets and everything turned a bit orange. So we got not-the-best goodbye from Tenerife but that's fine.
